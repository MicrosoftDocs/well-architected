# Sustainable AI Design

Designing, building, and operationalizing AI workloads **sustainably** is crucial as AI workloads consume significant energy and carbon throughout their lifecycle. Training large AI models, such as GPT-3, can consume up to 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, equivalent to producing 370 BMW cars or 320 Tesla electric vehicles1. To ensure the business value derived from AI does not compromise environmental balance, it is essential to adopt sustainable practices.


# AI Workload lifecycle

The AI workload lifecycle consists of three primary steps: Model Design, Data Design, and Operational Design. In this section we will look at the different design aspects that can be considered in each of these steps for factoring in sustainable software design in the lifecycle of AI workload development.

## Business Goal

Before we dive into the engineering aspects, it is important to understand the business problem if choosing AI is indeed the right step. 
Consider building an AI workload only:
•	If the problem requires learning from data over time
•	If the problem changes over time due to user behavior changes and market trends
•	If the problem requires the system to make decisions autonomously
•	If the problem involves dealing with complex, unstructured data 
•	If the problem involves creating new insights through predictive modeling 

## Key Recommendations for Sustainable AI Workloads:


### Model Design Considerations:

1. **Size of Model**: Opt for Small Language Models (SLMs) over Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce energy consumption.
2. **Reuse Models**: Utilize pre-trained models like ChatGPT, BERT, and GPT-3 to save energy cycles.
3.	**Energy-Efficient Frameworks**: Choose frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for their energy efficiency.
4. **Fine Tuning**: Pre-train models on general datasets before fine-tuning on specific domains to reduce computational cycles.
5. **Hosting Provider and Region**: Select regions powered by renewable energy sources for model training.

### Data Design Considerations:

1. **Data Processing**: Reuse publicly available datasets and architect data ingestion to pull only relevant data.
2. **Storage**: Store data in regions powered by renewable energy and consider edge computing.
3.	**Clean Data**: Ensure high-quality data for training to avoid wasted cycles.

### Operational Design Considerations:

1. **Hosting Provider and Region**:  Deploy models in regions using renewable energy sources.
2. **Frequency of Retraining**: Balance model accuracy with energy consumption by setting thresholds for retraining.
3.	**Monitoring**: Track model performance to prevent machine learning ops cycles from being wasted due to model decay.
By implementing these sustainable practices, AI developers and data scientists can significantly reduce the environmental impact of AI workloads while maintaining business value.
