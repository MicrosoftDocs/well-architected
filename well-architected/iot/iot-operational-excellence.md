# Operational excellence in your IoT workload

Given the complexity of IoT solutions requirements, organization's operational capabilities are important for driving sustainable business value. This guide focuses on the operational aspects of IoT devices and services that uniquely address the core requirements of an IoT solution.

Operational excellence in an IoT workload requires full visibility and control over all hardware and software components of the solution. Design, development, provisioning, monitoring, support, and maintenance practices must be agile and deliver business value without increasing operational risk.

In IoT solutions, the device diversity and scale, different network types, and geographically distributed locations significantly shift the cloud and hybrid [shared responsibility model](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility) away from the cloud provider. Cloud services make it easier for organizations to operate IoT devices and networks themselves or by using third parties, but the organizations themselves own the operational responsibility for these key elements of IoT workloads.

Operational excellence ensures that your IoT solution can successfully:

- Support different user roles.
- Manage all device lifecycle stages.
- Scale efficiently to meet changes on demand.
- Use automation for management and monitoring.
- Integrate with other back-end systems.

## Assess operational excellence in your IoT workload

To assess your IoT workload through the lenses of the Well-Architected Framework Operational Excellence pillar, complete the operational excellence  questions for IoT workloads in the [Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/azure-architecture-review/). After the assessment identifies key operational excellence recommendations for your IoT solution, use the following content to help implement the recommendations.

## Design Principles

[Five pillars of architectural excellence](../pillars.md) underpin the IoT workload design methodology. These pillars serve as a compass for subsequent design decisions across the [key IoT design areas](iot-overview.md#iot-design-areas). The following design principles extend the quality pillar of the Azure Well-Architected Framework - [Operational Excellence](../devops/overview.md).

|Design principle|Considerations|
|---|---|
|**Embrace continuous operations and scaling**|Ensure that the IoT solution can successfully manage automated device provisioning, integrate with other backend systems, support different roles such as solution developers, solution administrators, and operators, and adapt and scale efficiently to any changes on demand such as new IoT devices being deployed or higher ingestion throughput.|
|[**Optimize build and release processes**](../devops/principles.md#optimize-build-and-release-processes)|Any successful enterprise IoT solution requires a strategy to establish and update a device or fleet of device's configuration. A device's configuration includes device properties, connection settings, relationships, and firmware. IoT operators require simple and reliable tools that enable them to update a device or fleet of device's configuration at any point during the device's lifetime.|
|[**Understand operational health**](../devops/principles.md#understand-operational-health)|Use IoT solution logging, monitoring, and alerting systems to determine whether the solution is functioning as expected and to help troubleshoot problems throughout the lifecycle of the solution.|
|**Use automation and DevOps**|An IoT device is fundamentally a small computer with specialized hardware and software. IoT devices are often constrained in hardware, for example having limited memory or compute capacity. Automation and DevOps are essential to ensure that OS and software for IoT devices and gateways are properly uploaded and deployed to minimize operational downtime. Automation and DevOps are essential for monitoring and managing the lifecycle of IoT devices.|

## IoT architecture layers

Operational Excellence design principles help clarify considerations to ensure your IoT workload meets requirements across the [foundational IoT architecture layers](iot-overview.md#iot-architecture-layers).

The IoT core layers: Device and gateway, device management and modeling, and ingestion and communication, identify IoT-specific solutions. The other layers and cross-cutting activities are also common to, and often shared with, other workloads. DevOps cross-cutting activities are especially important to support the operational excellence pillar.

:::image type="content" source="media/architecture-layers.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the layers and cross-cutting activities in the IoT architecture." border="false":::

## Device and gateway layer

This layer represents the physical or virtual device and gateway hardware deployed at the edge or on premises.

A key factor in IoT operational excellence is an organization's ability to plan, provision, configure, monitor, and retire IoT devices. Organizations must select IoT hardware that meets business and technical requirements, and define appropriate testing procedures to ensure operational reliability.

Greenfield projects that use new hardware usually have more flexibility in device types, firmware and connectivity features, and technical specifications. You might need to select devices that comply with regional certification requirements or regulations such as CE, FCC, UL, PCI, or FDA.

Brownfield projects that already have hardware deployed typically have more hardware restrictions. You might need to look for other types of hardware, such as protocol or identity translation devices, or connectivity gateways such as Bluetooth to MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) gateway.

[Azure Certified Device Program](https://www.microsoft.com/azure/partners/azure-certified-device) certification validates that a device can connect with Azure IoT Hub and securely provision through the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS). The [Azure Certified Device Catalog](https://devicecatalog.azure.com) can help you find and select certified partner hardware. The Device Catalog has search and filter capabilities you can use to find hardware that meets your solution requirements.

An important feature to look for in Azure IoT-certified hardware is Azure Plug-and-Play and Digital Twins Definition Language (DTDL) compatibility. These features ensure that devices integrate seamlessly with services such as Azure Digital Twins. For Azure IoT Edge scenarios, it's important to find catalog devices that have the [IoT Edge Managed](/azure/certification/program-requirements-edge-managed) certification. This certification guarantees the device can run the IoT Edge runtime, and enables deployment and management of IoT Edge modules that support edge processing and analytics workloads.

Device components and spares must be available to cover maintenance and support contracts for the lifetime of the solution. Ensure a timely and secure equipment supply at the start of the project, because this requirement can be expensive to introduce later. Use a trusted vendor chain and consider dual or multiple supply sources.

## Ingestion and communication layer

The organization's network operations team typically partners with the telecommunication operator to handle the communication network technology stack of an IoT workload. Coordinate with your telecommunication operator to set up and operate the wired and wireless communication network components of your IoT solutions and operations.

### Capacity scaling

Configure the ingestion and other back-end layers of the IoT cloud solution to be able to scale to handle expected and unexpected capacity needs. If your solution is tied to a connected product, you must handle fluctuations in expected load. Load can be impacted by marketing initiatives such as sales or promotions, or by seasonal events such as holidays. You should test load variations prior to events, including unexpected events, to ensure that your IoT solution can scale.

Azure offers several options to meet capacity requirements as your business grows. Capacity planning and scaling for your IoT solution varies depending on whether you build an [IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/iot-central) or [IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/iot-hub)-based solution.

- IoT Central is a managed application platform that you can use to quickly evaluate your IoT scenario and assess the opportunities for your business. IoT Central takes care of most infrastructure elements however, it stores only 30 days of data. Because most IoT solutions export data to other services, you should focus on making sure those other services can handle expected and unexpected capacity needs during the evaluation of your solution.

- With an IoT Hub-based solution, it's your responsibility to scale up to handle growth in the number of messages being ingested and to scale out to handle regional demands. Understanding the number of messages that devices will send to IoT Hub and the sustained throughput is critical to selecting the correct IoT Hub tier to support the predicted demand.

  If you're approaching the IoT Hub message limit, your system should be able to automatically scale up IoT Hub to the next unit of capacity. Any back-end services in the IoT solution, such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Data Explorer must support scalability to ensure there are no bottlenecks anywhere in the solution's data flow.

You should also plan for edge device capacity needs and requirements. Whether you're managing real-time operating system (RTOS)-based devices or larger compute devices with IoT Edge, make sure compute and memory sizing are adequate for your specific use cases.

## Device management and modeling layer

Implement a centralized device management solution to administer, monitor, and operate the lifecycle of IoT devices, and to manage the overall configuration of the IoT solution. Consider implementing an integrated UI to assist operation teams with device fleet management.

### Device provisioning

Define a remote device provisioning strategy to enable zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning of IoT devices in the field without requiring human intervention.

For remote provisioning of IoT devices, [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](/azure/iot-dps/about-iot-dps) enables connecting and configuring remote devices to IoT Hub. DPS enables zero-touch provisioning without hard-coding information at the factory, and enables load-balancing of devices across multiple IoT hubs.

Although DPS supports symmetric key attestation, in a production environment you should use either the X.509 certificate or TPM attestation mechanisms. If you use X.509 certificates, you should deploy the root certificate, or an intermediate certificate signed by the root certificate to DPS, to allow devices in the field properly authenticate to the service and be assigned to their correct IoT hub.

Part of an IoT solution lifecycle includes reprovisioning devices in the field or moving them between IoT hubs. DPS enables the configuration of [reprovisioning policies](/azure/iot-dps/how-to-reprovision) that determine  expected behavior when an IoT device submits a new provisioning request. Devices should be programmed to send a provisioning request on reboot, and should implement a method to manually trigger provisioning on demand. This mechanism ensures that every time a device starts up, it contacts DPS to get redirected to the appropriate IoT hub.

### Device configuration and update management

Establish a strategy to update device or device fleet configuration. A device's configuration includes device properties, firmware, connection settings, and relationships. IoT operators need simple and reliable tools that let them update a device or device fleet's configuration at any point during the device's lifetime.

An IoT solution's scale and specific use of a device's configuration, influences the design of a configuration management strategy. It's important to automate this strategy as much as possible, and to ensure that the configuration can be set and updated efficiently.

A configuration management strategy should support:

- Inventory of IoT devices and IoT Edge devices deployed in the field.
- Gradual update rollout through device grouping.
- Resilient updates to support testing and rollbacks.
- Automatic updates for existing or new devices.
- Updated status reports and alerts.

Azure features that support these configuration management requirements include IoT Hub automatic device management, IoT Edge automatic deployments, IoT Hub scheduled jobs, and Device Update for IoT Hub.

- For continuous updates to existing or new devices and IoT Edge device configurations, such as properties, application specific settings, or relationships, use either IoT Hub automatic device management or IoT Edge automatic deployments. Both features offer an efficient, secure, and reliable way to automate configuration deployments for a fleet or specific group of devices. The services continuously monitor all new and existing targeted devices and their configuration based on tags, to ensure the devices always have the specified configuration. The key difference between these features is that automatic device management applies only to non-IoT Edge devices, and IoT Edge automatic deployments apply only to IoT Edge devices.

- To update an existing device or IoT Edge device configuration based on a one-time or recurring schedule, use IoT Hub scheduled jobs. This feature is an efficient, secure, and reliable way to provide a configuration update for a fleet or specific group of devices at a scheduled time.

- To update existing device or IoT Edge device firmware, application, or package updates over-the-air (OTA), use [Device Update for IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub-device-update/understand-device-update). This service is a safe, secure, and reliable way to update a fleet or specific group of devices.

It's a good idea to have a manual update method for IoT devices. Due to root certificate changes or connectivity issues, you may need to manually update devices by physically connecting to a local computer or using a local connectivity protocol such as Bluetooth.

To learn more about device management, see:

- [Azure IoT Hub Automatic Device Management](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-automatic-device-management)
- [Azure IoT Edge automatic deployments](/azure/iot-edge/module-deployment-monitoring)
- [Azure IoT Hub scheduled jobs](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-jobs#jobs-to-update-device-twin-properties)
- [Device Update for IoT Hub](/azure/iot-hub-device-update/understand-device-update)

### Management user interface

Solution operators and administrators need an interface to interact with the IoT solution, for example provision devices, add or remove users, send commands to IoT devices, or manage device updates.

IoT Central has a built-in, easy-to-use management interface that lets operators and administrators focus on adding industry knowledge, and evaluating the solution.

When you build your enterprise solution by using the platform services, such as IoT Hub and Azure Digital Twins you can build a custom management UI by using the REST APIs exposed in [IoT Hub REST APIs](/rest/api/iothub/) and [Azure Digital Twins REST APIs](/rest/api/azure-digitaltwins/).

## Integration layer

A typical IoT solution is composed of multiple components such as ingestion, routing, data storage, and data processing. It's important to document and have a good understanding of the entire data flow of the IoT solution. Have testing procedures in place to ensure the different parts of the solution work as expected and meet the technical and operational requirements of the organization. Implement automation to identify device capabilities at scale as they connect to your IoT solution and to easily integrate with back-end services.

Configure and test reliable integration with other Azure and third-party services that support the back-end and front-end services of the IoT application. A successful IoT implementation requires integrating IoT services such as IoT Hub and DPS with other Azure and third-party services.

For example, DPS supports custom allocation policies by using custom code and Azure Functions, so it's important to confirm that the Azure Function allows traffic coming from DPS and IoT Hub. Another example is the integration between IoT Hub and backend services to enable features such as message routing and file upload. IoT Hub needs to properly authenticate to those Azure services. You should use managed identities to eliminate the need to manage those credentials manually.

## DevOps layer

DevOps includes role and user management, metrics collection, monitoring, and automation.

### Role and user management

A key decision early in a solution design phase is to define the roles that implement and manage the solution. Determine the roles that are responsible for developing, managing, and operating the IoT solution at scale, and the users assigned to those roles.

Ideally, the solution should trust a centralized identity provider, such as [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis), and only let the appropriate users in those roles perform management or operation activities, such as creating and provisioning new devices, sending commands to hardware in the field, deploying updates, and modifying user permissions.

In an IoT Hub-based solution, you can use Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate requests to IoT Hub service APIs, such as creating device identities or invoking direct methods. You can develop a custom management UI for solution operators and administrators, that authenticates users against Microsoft Entra ID and executes API requests to the IoT solution back end on behalf of those users.

### IoT Edge Metrics Collector

Azure IoT Edge provides the [IoT Edge Metrics Collector](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoft_iot_edge.metrics-collector?tab=overview) ready-to-use IoT Edge module in the IoT Edge Module Marketplace. Add this module to an IoT Edge deployment to collect metrics and send them to Azure Monitor. The open-source module code is a multi-architecture Docker container image that supports Linux x64, ARM32, and ARM64 version 1809.

The Metrics Collector module can collect logs from all the modules that can emit metrics by using the [Prometheus data model](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/). While [built-in metrics](/azure/iot-edge/how-to-access-built-in-metrics) enable broad workload visibility by default, you can also use custom modules to emit scenario-specific metrics that enhance the monitoring solution.

There are two options to send metrics from the Metrics Collector module to the cloud:

- Send the metrics to Log Analytics. The collected metrics are ingested into the specified Log Analytics workspace using a fixed, native table called `InsightsMetrics`.

- Send the metrics to IoT Hub. You can configure the collector module to send the collected metrics as UTF-8 encoded JSON device-to-cloud messages through the edge hub module. This option unlocks monitoring of locked-down IoT Edge devices that are only allowed external access to the IoT Hub endpoint.

The `AllowedMetrics` and `BlockedMetrics` configuration options take space- or comma-separated lists of metric selectors. A metric is matched to the list and included or excluded if it matches one or more metrics in either list.

You can visually explore metrics collected from IoT Edge devices by using Azure Monitor workbooks. Curated workbooks use built-in metrics from the IoT Edge runtime that are ingested into a Log Analytics workspace. These views don't need any metrics instrumentation from the workload modules.

The Azure portal provides curated monitoring workbooks for IoT Edge devices as public templates. To access the workbooks, from your **IoT Hub** or **IoT Central** page in the Azure portal, navigate to the **Workbooks** page in the **Monitoring** section.

### Monitoring

Use IoT solution logging, monitoring, and alerting systems to determine whether the solution is functioning as expected and to help troubleshoot and mitigate problems. Monitoring and logging help determine whether devices or systems are in an error condition, correctly configured, generating accurate data, and meeting defined service level objectives.

IoT logging and monitoring systems can be more complicated than in standard line-of-business applications. The complexity arises because IoT solutions often span:

- Physical sensors that interact with an environment.
- Applications on the edge doing activities like data shaping and protocol translation.
- Infrastructure components such as on-premises gateways, firewalls, and switches.
- Ingestion and messaging services.
- Persistence mechanisms.
- Insight and reporting applications.
- Subsystems that operate and scale independently in the cloud.

The following simplified logging and monitoring architecture shows examples of typical IoT solution components and how they use recommended technologies.

:::image type="content" source="media/logging-monitoring.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows example logging and monitoring systems." border="false" lightbox="media/logging-monitoring.png":::

If your critical applications and business processes rely on Azure resources, you should monitor those resources for availability and performance. You can use [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) to carry out the following monitoring activities:

- Detect and diagnose issues across applications and dependencies with [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).
- Correlate infrastructure issues with [VM Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview) and [Container Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview).
- Drill into your monitoring data with [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview) for troubleshooting and deep diagnostics.
- Support operations at scale with [smart alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-smartgroups-overview) and [automated actions](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-action-rules).
- Create visualizations with Azure [dashboards](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards) and [workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview).
- Collect data from [monitored resources](/azure/azure-monitor/monitor-reference) using [Azure Monitor Metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics).

#### Monitor IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub collects the same types of monitoring data as other Azure resources, as described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data). The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each IoT hub includes charts that provide some usage metrics, such as the number of messages used and the number of devices connected to the hub. The information on the **Overview** page is useful, but represents only a small amount of the monitoring data available for an IoT hub.

Some monitoring data is collected automatically and is available for analysis as soon as you create your IoT hub. You can configure other types of data collection. To learn more about the metrics and logs that IoT Hub creates, see [Monitoring Azure IoT Hub data reference](/azure/iot-hub/monitor-iot-hub-reference).

#### Monitor updates

As with any deployment or update, you should monitor the update state of deployments and devices. DevOps provides a way to consistently deliver fresh software updates. Device Update for IoT Hub monitors compliance by measuring how many devices have installed the highest version compatible update. A device is compliant if it has installed the highest version available compatible update.

#### Monitor configuration

As with any deployment or update, you should monitor and alert on the status of a device configuration or update deployment. Each Azure IoT configuration service collects and stores logs and metrics in Azure Monitor. You can use this data to create Azure Monitor alerts to send notifications when a configuration deployment or update is created, completed, or failed.

If the monitoring data provided by each of the Azure IoT configuration services isn't enough, the Azure IoT Hub service APIs offer a more granular view.

#### Monitor automation and DevOps

DPS, IoT Hub, and IoT Edge provide continuous metrics and status updates that are key inputs to monitor continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) status or automation script output. You can collect and analyze these metrics in a Log Analytics workspace and then define alerts.

- [Collect and transport metrics](/azure/iot-edge/how-to-collect-and-transport-metrics)

### Automation

An IoT device is fundamentally a small computer with specialized hardware and software. IoT devices are often hardware-constrained, for example have limited memory or compute capacity. Automation and DevOps ensure that IoT device and gateway software is properly uploaded and deployed to minimize operational downtime. Automation and DevOps are essential to monitoring and managing the full lifecycle of developing, deploying, and operating an IoT solution and devices.

The key benefit of a mature DevOps implementation is agility, the ability to quickly sense and respond to changes in business needs. To use automation with DevOps for agile software development, deployment, testing, integration, and operations, follow these recommendations:

- Use CI/CD DevOps principles and processes to boost productivity and create a seamless rapid development cycle.

- Deploy application software changes in an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) environment to automate and manage the ongoing operation of deployed software.

- Automate the IoT application software lifecycle from development through testing to deployment to IT operations.

- Use DevOps tools and processes in IoT Hub and IoT Edge to automate the edge software lifecycle. Use IoT Edge to deploy IoT application software on devices.

- Provide operators with tools to gain visibility and insights, collaborate, control, and maintain a reliable IoT solution.

- Embrace cross-functional teams to deliver continuously for solutions. Device vendors and cross-functional solution developers should work together to develop and deploy IoT solutions.

- Evolve business and deployment models to create possibilities for different business models and pilot validation, deployment, and enhancements.

### Automate device lifecycle

Connected IoT Edge devices have a lifecycle that extends beyond deploy, break and fix, and retire. Connected devices put organizations in the best position to capitalize on opportunity and continuously add incremental innovation throughout the system lifecycle.

In IoT solutions, software programs installed on hardware define system functionality. Thousands of devices might be connected to a single cloud endpoint such as IoT Hub. Any change in configuration or software must be spread across all the devices. To change system functionality, update software instead of making hardware changes or local interventions.

When you implement automation and DevOps in IoT systems, follow specific automation and DevOps requirements for each device lifecycle phase. The following tables describe Azure IoT features that support three phases of the device lifecycle.
