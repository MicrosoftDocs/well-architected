# Assessment review tool for SaaS workloads on Azure

The [Azure Well-Architected SaaS workload assessment](/assessments/d349c8c3-fe9c-4829-afdd-a5228e72a570) is a review tool that independent software vendors (ISVs) can use to self-assess the readiness of their software as a service (SaaS) workload. You need to make complex decisions for your SaaS design. You can use the assessment to methodically check your alignment with best practices for the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars.

For best results, a team that has familiarity with the architecture of your workload should complete the assessment. That team should also have a strong understanding of cloud principles and patterns. These roles include cloud architects, operators, and DevOps engineers.

The questions in the assessment are based on the [SaaS workload design areas](get-started.md#how-to-use-this-guidance). These design areas help you check the foundational design choices of your workload's architecture and your end-to-end operational approach.
