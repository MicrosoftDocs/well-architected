# Testing and validation for carrier-grade workloads

Continuous testing and validation can detect and help resolve issues before they become potentially life threatening. Consider well-known testing methodologies such as chaos testing. Testing should be conducted for the lifetime of the application because the deployment environment is complex and multi-layered.

> More details on how to implement continuous validation for your mission-critical workload is available [here](/azure/well-architected/mission-critical/mission-critical-deployment-testing#video-continuously-validate-your-mission-critical-workload).

Also, supportability must be strong throughout the application lifetime. Highly available systems rely on high quality support teams able to rapidly respond to and resolve issues in the field, conduct root cause analysis and look for systematic design flaws.

Proving that an application is well architected requires testing, ideally use a chaos testing framework to avoid testing bias. This methodology simulates failures of all dependent elements. Robust and regular testing should both prove the design and validate the original failure mode analysis.

A warning flag should be raised for any application or service for which the redundancy or resiliency measures can't be tested because it's considered *too risky*.

If redundancy and resiliency measures aren't tested, then the only valid assumption, from a safety-critical point of view, is that these measures aren't going to work when needed. Using common paths for software upgrades, configuration updates, and fault recovery, for example, provide a good mechanism for validating that measures will work.

## Human error

Experience from Telcos is that as much as 60% of all outages are actually the result of human error.  A well-architected application recognizes this and seeks to compensate.  Here are some suggested approaches, but the list is not exhaustive, and what is applicable to a given workload needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  

- Maximizing use of automation avoids human operators having to enter long and complex commands or conduct repetitive operations across multiple elements.  However, care must be taken to consider the blast radius, as there is a risk of automation actually magnifying the effect of a configuration error, allowing it to roll out across a global network in seconds.  Strong checks and balances such as decision gates requiring human approval before proceeding to the next step are advised.
- Leveraging syntax checkers and simulation tools minimize the chance of errors or unforeseen side effects from changes making their way into widespread production.
- Use of carefully controlled canary deployments ensure that the effect of changes in full production can be observed and validated at limited scope.
- Ensuring that the management interfaces and processes needed for fault recovery are the same as those used in day-to-day operation avoid operators being confronted with unfamiliar screens and barely used method of procedures (MOPs) at times of peak stress.


## Clients

Common client libraries are also part of the end-to-end system and need equivalent analysis and testing. Software issues in common client code that simultaneously impacts a proportion of the system clients will impact overall availability in the same way as application server-side issues.
