    summary: As solution architects, you want to build reliable, secure, and performant workloads that maximize the value of investment in Azure infrastructure. Start with the Pillars, and align your design choices with the principles. Then, build a strong foundation for your workload based on technical design areas. Finally, use review tools to assess your readiness in deploying to production.

            - Azure App Service (Web Apps) is a platform as a service (PaaS) compute solution that you can use to host your workload on the Azure platform.

            - The fully managed service abstracts the underlying compute and offloads the responsibility of building, deploying, and scaling to the platform. 

            - Find checklists that help you assess architectural concerns and design strategies that align with the Well-Architected Framework. 
            
            - Consider recommendations and tradeoffs as you design your workload on Azure App Service.
