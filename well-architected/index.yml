            - Health modeling combines business context with monitoring data to quantify the overall health of a workload.

            - The health model provides a baseline to help identify drift from the expected operational state of a workload.

            - Health models visualize health states across dependency chains, making it easier for operators to take action.
            
            - The health score captures key business requirements as measurements to provide a meaningful view of workload health.
