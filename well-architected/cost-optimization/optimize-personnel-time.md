**Applies to this Azure Well-Architected Framework Cost Optimization checklist recommendation:** 

|[CO:13](checklist.md)| Optimize personnel time. Align the time personnel spends on tasks with the priority of the task. The goal is to reduce the time spent on tasks without degrading the outcome. Optimization efforts should include minimizing noise, reducing build times, high fidelity debugging, and production mocking.| 
|---|---| 

This guide describes the recommendations for optimizing personnel time. This optimization is a strategic process of maximizing the productivity and efficiency of employees that design, implement, and operate the workload during their working hours. It involves aligning their skills, strengths, and tasks in a manner that ensures that every hour they spend at work is used most effectively. The goal is to eliminate wasted personnel potential and capabilities. Failure to optimize personnel time can lead to employee burnout, reduced competitive edge, and reduced productivity.

**Definitions**

| Term| Definition|
|---|---|
| Noise | Irrelevant or misleading information that can distract from actual issues or trends.|
| Signal| Meaningful and relevant information that provides insights into the behavior and performance of a system or application. |
| Technical debt | The accumulated inefficiencies, suboptimal design choices, or shortcuts intentionally taken during the development process to deliver code faster.|

## Key design strategies

Personnel typically create the most significant expense in a workload. Personnel cost and value underscore the importance of efficient time management. This guide is about maximizing the potential of every hour worked. Given that employees can't work all day and night, the emphasis is on ensuring that each person is more effective within their designated hours or equally effective in a reduced timeframe. The goal is to achieve better utilization of their time for the benefit of the individual and the workload.

### Set optimization targets

Setting personnel time optimization targets is a process of establishing clear, measurable goals. These targets serve as guidelines for desired improvements in tasks and functions. You can use these benchmarks to evaluate outcomes against the targets. First, define the metrics for measuring the success of personnel time optimization efforts. Determine the specific objectives that you want to achieve through optimization. Example objectives might be to reduce time spent on administrative tasks or to reduce the time it takes to respond to customer inquiries. To set targets for personnel time optimization, consider the following strategies:

- *Select quantitative metrics*: Choose metrics that align with your objectives and can be measured accurately. Consider metrics like time saved, productivity increases, efficiency improvements, and task completion time.

- *Gather qualitative metrics*: In addition to quantitative metrics, gather feedback from personnel to measure their satisfaction with their roles. This feedback can provide valuable insights into the effects of personnel time optimization efforts on employee morale and engagement.

- *Set targets*: Set realistic and achievable targets for each selected metric. These targets should be based on the current performance levels and the desired level of improvement.

### Optimize development time

Optimizing development involves refining the software development processes to achieve greater efficiency. As a result, developers can invest more time in refining features, innovating within the constraints of a particular workload, and addressing any unique challenges that the workload presents.

#### Keep features lean

When you design and customize features, keep them lean and simple. Avoid unnecessary complexity and configuration options that can increase the time required to develop, test, and maintain the workload. Keeping the workload simple and focused leads to easier adaptability and optimization over time.

#### Reduce build times

Reducing build times is the process of minimizing the time it takes to compile and generate a deployment. Shorter build times enable developers to spend less time waiting for builds to finish and allows them to focus on writing code and delivering features. Reducing build times also helps ensure that developers receive feedback on their code changes more quickly. Quicker feedback allows them to iterate and fix issues faster, which supports the Agile development model. Faster build times facilitate more frequent builds, enabling teams to adopt Agile development practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Here are some strategies for reducing build times:

- *Optimize build configurations*: Review the build configuration settings and eliminate unnecessary steps or processes that add overhead to the build process. Checkpointing builds and combining partial builds with prebuilt builds can help reduce build times and improve efficiency. This approach enables you to reuse previously built components and build only the necessary parts, which leads to faster build times and reduced time investment.

- *Parallelize build tasks*: Identify tasks that can be run simultaneously and configure the build system to run them in parallel. Take advantage of available computing resources.

- *Use caching*: Cache dependencies, intermediate build artifacts, and other reusable components to avoid redundant work during subsequent builds.

- *Use incremental builds*: To avoid unnecessary recompilation, implement techniques that allow the build system to rebuild only the parts of the deployment that changed since the previous build.

- *Distribute the build process*: If applicable, distribute the build process across multiple machines or build agents to use parallelism and reduce overall build time.

- *Optimize infrastructure*: Ensure that the build environment has sufficient resources, like CPU, memory, and disk I/O, to handle the build.

#### Use production mocking

By mocking components or services, developers can isolate their code for focused testing by simulating dependencies. Mocking enables developers to create specific scenarios and edge cases that are difficult or impractical to reproduce in a real production environment. It can speed up testing cycles, facilitate parallel work, and eliminate troubleshooting dependencies. Here are some approaches to implementing production mocking:

- *Mocking frameworks*: Use specialized mocking frameworks or libraries that enable you to create mock objects, stubs, or fakes to replace dependencies.

- *Dependency injection*: Design your application to use dependency injection, which enables easy substitution of real dependencies with mock objects during testing or debugging.

- *Service virtualization*: Use service virtualization tools or techniques to simulate the behavior of external services or APIs. Doing so enables developers to test integrations without accessing the real services.

- *Configuration-driven mocking*: Implement a configuration-driven approach in which the application's behavior can be modified via configuration settings or flags to enable mocking as needed.

- *Dynamic and conditional mocking*: Design the application to support dynamic and conditional mocking, which enable developers to switch between real and mock components depending on specific conditions or scenarios.

#### Optimize the development environment

The goal is for developers to get fast feedback on changes. Make necessary technology changes to improve the development experience.

*Containerization*: Consider containerizing the workload to run locally. Containers help developers replicate the production environment locally and test their changes quickly. They enable faster iteration and debugging, which leads to a more efficient development process. Containers also provide a consistent and isolated environment for running the application. Finally, they enable easy scaling and deployment of the application.

*Developer workstations*: An optimal developer workstation should have a suitable integrated development environment (IDE). A good developer workstation boosts developer efficiency, reducing the time and resources needed for various tasks. A good IDE provides code completion and syntax highlighting tailored to the programming language. It should also support version control like Git. A well-equipped IDE enables developers to pinpoint and fix issues quickly during development, which reduces debugging time.

*Developer environments*: Developers' environments shouldn't be too constrained. Developers should have the permissions necessary to complete tasks without undue restrictions so they can work efficiently and effectively.

#### Optimize preproduction environments

In general, the closer preproduction environments are to production environments, the more time you save. This increased consistency also helps to minimize risk. The closer the two environments are, the better you can test and validate the functionality and performance of your releases before deploying them to the production environment. This similarity in environments helps you identify and address any issues or bottlenecks early on, which reduces the risk of problems occurring in the production environment.

> ![Tradeoff icon](../_images/trade-off.svg) **Tradeoff**: You need to balance personnel time against resource costs. The closer an environment is to the production environment, the more it costs.

#### Reuse components and libraries

Reusable components and libraries can save developers substantial amounts of time. Instead of writing, testing, and debugging code, developers can reuse validated components and libraries and develop or fix application features faster. Be sure to provide documentation for each component or library. Store the code and documentation in a central repository that has version control like GitHub.

Additionally, use open-source software or libraries from trusted publishers that are available in package managers, like NuGet or Maven. These package managers provide a centralized and reliable source for accessing and managing libraries. Using trusted libraries from package managers can further enhance productivity and reduce the time spent on developing and maintaining code.

#### Remove technical debt

Removing technical debt is essential for maintaining a healthy and efficient codebase. By following specific standards and implementing mechanisms like quality gates, you can effectively address technical debt and improve the overall quality of your code. Here's how you can incorporate this guidance into your approach:

- *Allocate time to resolve technical debt*: Dedicate a portion of your development team's time to resolving technical debt. A good starting point is to allocate about 20% of the team's time specifically to addressing technical debt. The dedicated time enables developers to focus on refactoring, code cleanup, and improving the overall quality of the codebase.

- *Empower the development team*: Allow the development team to own the prioritization of technical debt resolution. The development team is in the best position to identify areas of the codebase that require attention and understand the effects of technical debt on workload functionality. Encourage open communication and collaboration within the team to ensure that technical debt is addressed effectively.

- *Prioritize*: Prioritize technical debt items based on their effects on workload functionality. Focus on addressing the issues that have the most significant effect on the performance, maintainability, and scalability of the workload. By prioritizing effectively, you can maximize the effects of your efforts to remove technical debt.

Removing technical debt is an ongoing process. It requires a proactive approach and continuous effort from the development team. By setting and adhering to specific standards in the codebase and implementing mechanisms like quality gates, you can effectively address technical debt and create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase:

- *Set coding standards*: Establish clear and specific coding standards that define the desired structure, style, and best practices for your codebase. These standards should cover areas like naming conventions, code formatting, documentation, and error handling. By adhering to these standards, you ensure consistency and readability throughout the codebase.

- *Implement quality gates*: Quality gates are mechanisms that enforce the defined coding standards and catch potential issues early in the development process. They can include automated code reviews, static code analysis tools, and continuous integration pipelines. By integrating quality gates into your development workflow, you can identify and address code quality issues before they become technical debt.

### Optimize personnel collaboration

Optimizing personnel collaboration is a process of enhancing team dynamics, communication, and knowledge-sharing. The goal is to prevent misunderstandings, duplicated efforts, and wasted time. It involves breaking down silos, revising unnecessary standards, creating shared knowledge repositories, and investing in relevant training. Effective collaboration reduces repeated errors and maximizes the collective expertise of a team. To optimize personnel collaboration, consider the following strategies:

- *Eliminate silos*: Silos can lead to a lack of shared knowledge and unnecessary replication of tasks. Cross-functional collaboration can save time and improve results. Break down barriers between departments or teams to promote inter-departmental cooperation. Foster cross-departmental meetings, workshops, and joint projects. Encourage open communication channels across teams.

- *Optimize standards*: Unnecessary standards can lead to wasted time and resources without contributing to better outcomes. Assess, improve, or eliminate standards or protocols that don't add value but increase the workload. Periodically review standards and protocols. Get feedback from ground-level employees. If a standard doesn't add value, consider eliminating or revising it.

- *Create a shared knowledge repository*: A shared knowledge base prevents repeated mistakes, aids training, and reduces the time spent searching for information. Develop a centralized place where all members can access and contribute to collective knowledge. Employ knowledge management tools, regularly update the repository, and incentivize contributions from team members.

- *Invest in training*: Make a substantial investment in training for the processes, tools, and project. Doing so ensures that a baseline requirement is met before people start contributing to the project. Ensure that teams are trained on the established standards and processes to enable them to work efficiently and effectively within the defined guidelines. Team members should be trained on those standards and processes so that they don't waste effort identifying them on their own.

### Optimize processes

Optimizing processes involves refining workflows to eliminate unnecessary steps, reduce manual effort, and streamline roles and change management. This enhancement ensures that tasks are more efficient. Streamlined processes reduce the time and resources needed for tasks. The time reduction leads to improved productivity and saves money. To optimize processes, consider these recommendations:

- *Refine the software development lifecycle (SDLC) approach*: Adopting an optimal SDLC can help you achieve high quality with less overhead. Assess your current SDLC method and consider more efficient alternatives. Explore and adopt methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, or Waterfall. Periodically reassess chosen frameworks for better efficiency, recognizing that SDLC is inherently collaborative.

- *Optimize per role*: Defined roles ensure clear responsibilities and expectations and increased efficiency. Understand and define the requirements of each role, including, for example, developers and solution architects. When you want to expand the team, you should know what each role needs in terms of hardware, licenses, and access.

- *Streamline change management*: Positive receptiveness to change ensures smoother transitions and better outcomes. Make the process of implementing change smooth and accepted. Cultivate a culture of active participation rather than resistance. Promote change adoption via coaching and continuous learning. Adapt to change constructively.

### Optimize operational tasks

Optimizing workload operational tasks is a process of making job tasks faster and more straightforward. The goal is to streamline activities to enhance efficiency and ensure the most effective use of resources. This streamlining ensures that tasks are completed with fewer errors, distractions, and delays. It conserves personnel time, which leads to faster decision-making, reduced troubleshooting durations, and overall improved efficiency and cost savings. To optimize operational tasks, consider the following strategies.

#### Reduce the noise-to-signal ratio

Distinguishing signal from noise is crucial to observability because it enables teams to focus on the most critical aspects of their systems and applications. Filtering out noise can help teams make informed decisions, troubleshoot problems, and optimize the workload faster. Identifying and addressing issues more efficiently and quickly leads to a reduction in personnel costs.

To differentiate signal from noise, you need to define clear objectives and metrics. Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that are relevant to your workload. Establish thresholds or ranges for each metric to specify normal behavior and what should be flagged as an anomaly. Use monitoring tools to collect data and track the defined metrics in real time and identify patterns that indicate potential issues or areas of improvement.

Prioritize actionable insights. Focus on insights that point to degradations in the workload and prioritize them for further investigation or action. Regularly review and update your monitoring strategy based on feedback.

#### Use high fidelity debugging

*High fidelity debugging* refers to the ability to accurately diagnose and fix issues in software applications. You gain detailed insights into the application's behavior and state during runtime. High fidelity debugging is crucial for effective software development and troubleshooting. With high fidelity debugging, developers can reproduce and analyze issues with greater precision, which reduces the time and effort required to fix bugs. An understanding of the application's behavior enables developers to make informed decisions faster to improve code quality.

- *Use a debugging tool*: Use a feature-rich debugger that provides comprehensive insights into the application's execution flow, variables, and memory state.

- *Enable detailed logging and tracing*: Instrument code with logging and tracing statements to capture relevant information during runtime. Doing so helps you diagnose issues.

- *Analyze error messages and stack traces*: Carefully examine error messages and stack traces to understand the context and sequence of events leading to an issue.

#### Enhance technical support

Improve the efficiency and efficacy of technical support operations. Reducing recurring issues saves time and improves user satisfaction. Identify recurring support issues, integrate engineering and support teams via support shadowing, and adopt IT classic deployment model processes to reduce overall support load.

#### Learn from incidents

Analyzing incidents can prevent recurrence and improve reaction times. Use past incidents as learning opportunities for future improvement. Conduct retrospectives to analyze incidents, identify improved actions and contact protocols, and enhance system observability through comprehensive logs and metrics.

#### Implement robust governance

Standardization reduces errors and rework to ensure consistent quality and cost optimization. Strengthen compliance and standardization within your organization. Automate compliance checks, and advocate for standardized solutions, architectures, and blueprints. To streamline decision-making, minimize choices that don't align with organizational constraints or SLAs.

### Optimize personnel skills

Better skills lead to increased efficiency and fewer mistakes. Invest in the development and improvement of your team's skills. To optimize personnel skills, here are some recommendations to consider:

- *Upskilling*: Ensure that team members have essential cost optimization and monitoring skills. Provide sandbox environments for hands-on learning and skill development. Encourage team members to obtain certifications, and promote shadowing with experienced colleagues.

- *Tools*: Proficiency with tools is a key skill for optimizing tasks and gaining valuable insights for cost management. Ensure that personnel are proficient with essential tools and can adapt to new ones. Prioritize familiarity with key tools, especially tools that are related to monitoring. Train personnel to extract meaningful insights from data across various layers of the system, emphasizing the link between effective monitoring and cost management.

- *Aligned expertise*: Match employees to tasks based on their skills and expertise. Utilize their strengths and allocate tasks accordingly to maximize efficiency.
