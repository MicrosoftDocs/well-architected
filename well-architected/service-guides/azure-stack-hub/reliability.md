# Azure Stack Hub and reliability

[Azure Stack Hub](/azure-stack/operator/?view=azs-2102&preserve-view=true) is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you provide Azure services from your datacenter. It provides a way to run apps in an on-premises environment.

This service unlocks the following hybrid cloud use cases for customer-facing and internal line-of-business apps:

- *Edge and disconnected solutions*: Addresses latency and connectivity requirements by processing data locally.
- *Cloud apps that meet varied regulations*: Allows you to develop and deploy apps with full flexibility to meet regulatory or policy requirements.
- *Cloud app model on-premises*: Provides Azure services, containers, serverless, and microservice architectures to update and extend existing apps or build new ones.

For more information, reference [Azure Stack Hub overview](/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-overview?view=azs-2102&preserve-view=true).

To understand how Azure Stack Hub supports resiliency for your application workload, reference the following articles:

- [Storage Spaces Direct cache and capacity tiers](/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-capacity-planning-storage?view=azs-2102#storage-spaces-direct-cache-and-capacity-tiers&preserve-view=true)

The following sections include design considerations, a configuration checklist, and recommended configuration options specific to Azure Stack Hub and reliability.

## Design considerations

Azure Stack Hub includes the following design considerations:

- Microsoft doesn't provide an SLA for Azure Stack Hub because Microsoft doesn't have control over customer datacenter reliability, people, and processes.
- Azure Stack Hub only supports a single Scale Unit (SU) within a single region, which consists of between four and 16 servers that use Hyper-V failover clustering. Each region serves as an independent Azure Stack Hub *stamp* with separate portal and API endpoints.
- Azure Stack Hub doesn't support Availability Zones because it consists of a single *region* or a single physical location. High availability to cope with outages of a single location should be implemented by using two Azure Stack Hub instances deployed in different physical locations.
- Azure Stack Hub supports premium storage to ensure compatibility. However, provisioning premium storage accounts or disks doesn't guarantee that storage objects will be allocated onto SSD or NVMe drives.
- Azure Stack Hub supports only a subset of [VPN Gateway SKUs](/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways?view=azs-2102#estimated-aggregate-throughput-by-sku&preserve-view=true) available in Azure with a limited bandwidth of `100` or `200` `Mbps`.
- Only one site-to-site (S2S) VPN connection can be created between two Azure Stack Hub deployments. This connection limit is because of a platform limitation that allows only a single VPN connection to the same IP address. Multiple S2S VPN connections with higher throughput can be established using third-party NVAs.
- Apply general Azure configuration recommendations for all Azure Stack Hub services.

## Checklist

**Have you configured Azure Stack Hub with reliability in mind?**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Treat Azure Stack Hub as a scale unit and deploy multiple instances to remove Azure Stack Hub as a single point of failure for encompassed workloads.

## Configuration recommendations

Consider the following recommendation table to optimize your Azure Stack Hub configuration for reliability:

|Recommendation|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Treat Azure Stack Hub as a scale unit and deploy multiple instances to remove Azure Stack Hub as a single point of failure for encompassed workloads.|Deploy workloads in either an active-active or active-passive configuration across Azure Stack Hub stamps or Azure.|
