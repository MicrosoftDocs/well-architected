# Operational excellence and Traffic Manager

[Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/) is a Domain Name System (DNS)-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public-facing applications across the global Azure regions. Traffic Manager also provides your public endpoints with high availability and quick responsiveness.

Features include:

- [Increase application availability](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview#increase-application-availability)
- [Improve application performance](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview#improve-application-performance)
- [Service maintenance without downtime](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview#service-maintenance-without-downtime)
- [Combine hybrid applications](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview#combine-hybrid-applications)
- [Distribute traffic for complex deployments](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview#distribute-traffic-for-complex-deployments)

## Checklist

**Have you configured Traffic Manager with operational excellence in mind?**

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - If the Time to Live (TTL) interval of the DNS record is too long, consider adjusting the health probe timing or DNS record TTL.

## Configuration recommendations

Consider the following recommendation for operational excellence when configuring Traffic Manager:

|Recommendation|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|If the Time to Live (TTL) interval of the DNS record is too long, consider adjusting the health probe timing or DNS record TTL.|When a backend becomes unavailable, Traffic Manager won't fail over to another region immediately. There will be a time interval where clients can't be served. The length of this interval depends on the time settings of the health probe (probe interval and the number of unhealthy responses allowed). If the resulting interval is still too large for the scenario, consider switching to Azure Front Door for global load balancing.|
