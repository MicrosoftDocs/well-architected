# Azure Well-Architected Framework review - Virtual Machines

[Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/) is an on-demand, scalable computing resource that gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain physical hardware to run it. 

In this article, you learn architectural best practices for Azure Virtual Machines. The guidance is based on the five pillars of architectural excellence:

- Reliability
- Security
- Cost optimization
- Operational excellence
- Performance efficiency


## Prerequisites

- Understanding the Well-Architected Framework pillars can help produce a high quality, stable, and efficient cloud architecture. We recommend that you review your workload using the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review&mode=pre-assessment) assessment.

- Use a reference architecture to review the considerations based on the guidance provided in this article. For more information, see [Linux VM](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/n-tier/linux-vm#architecture) and [ Windows VM](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm#architecture) for reference VM architecture on Azure.


## Reliability
As you make design choices for virtual machines, review the [design principles](/azure/well-architected/resiliency/principles) for adding reliability to the architecture.

### Design checklist
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Review the [SLAs for virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9/).
> - VMs should be deployed in a scale set [using the Flexible orchestration mode](/azure/virtual-machines/flexible-virtual-machine-scale-sets).
> - Deployed VMs across [Availability Zones](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal).
> - Package and publish application artifacts with [VM Applications](/azure/virtual-machines/vm-applications) and [Azure Compute Gallery](/azure/virtual-machines/azure-compute-gallery).
> - Install applications on [Ephemeral OS disks](/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks).
> - Use [Maintenance Configurations](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-configurations) to control and manage updates for VMs.

### Recommendations
Explore the following table of recommendations to optimize your Virtual Machine configuration for service reliability:

|Recommendation|Benefit|
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Review SLAs for virtual machines. | When defining test availability and recovery targets, make sure you have a good understanding of the SLAs offered for VMs.|
| Deploy using Flexible scale sets. | Even single instance VMs should be deployed into a scale set using the Flexible orchestration mode to future-proof your application for scaling and availability. Flexible orchestration offers high availability guarantees (up to 1000 VMs) by spreading VMs across fault domains in a region or within an Availability Zone.|
| Deploy across availability zones | Azure availability zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures.
| Install applications on Ephemeral OS disks. | Separating data from the OS disk makes it easier to recover from failures, migrate workloads, and can improve performance.
| Use Maintenance Configuration | Control and manage updates for both Windows and Linux VMs through a centralized view for OS patching. |

>[!TIP]
>For more details on Reliability guidance for VMs, see [Reliability in Azure Virtual Machines - Azure Virtual Machines](/azure/reliability/reliability-virtual-machines).

## Security

This article provides an overview of the core Azure security features that can be used with virtual machines.

As you make design choices for virtual machines, review the [security principles](/azure/well-architected/security/security-principles) and [Security best practices](/azure/security/fundamentals/iaas) for adding security to the architecture.


### Design checklist


As you make design choices for your virtual machine deployment, review the [design principles](/azure/well-architected/security/security-principles) for security.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Review the [Linux security baseline](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/virtual-machines-linux-security-baseline).
> - Review the [Windows security baseline](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/virtual-machines-windows-security-baseline).
> - Manage authentication and access control by ensuring strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control are in place for your VMs.
> - Protect against malicious actor scenarios: Implement security best practices such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and intrusion detection systems to protect against malware attacks, and DoS attacks
> - Plan and implement managed updates: Test updates in a non-production environment before deploying them to production, and consider using Azure Update Management to automate the update process.
> - Classify and configure encryption based on data sensitivity and include using Encryption at Host and SSL/TLS encryption.

### Recommendations

Explore the following table of recommendations to optimize your virtual machine configuration for security.

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|--------|----|
| Consider using Azure Bastion | Authentication and access control using [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS|
| Protect against malware | Install [antimalware protection](/azure/security/fundamentals/iaas#protect-against-malware) to help identify and remove viruses. |
| Manage updates | Use a solution like [Azure Automation](/azure/automation/update-management/overview) to manage operating system updates and maintain security compliance with critical updates. |
| Monitor for security | To monitor the security posture of your Windows and Linux VMs, use [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction). |
| Use encryption | Use [Azure Disk Encryption](/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-disk-encryption-vms-vmss) to protect your data. |

For more suggestions, see [Principles of the security pillar](/azure/well-architected/security/security-principles).

Azure Advisor helps you ensure and improve security. Review the [security recommendations](/azure/advisor/advisor-security-recommendations).

### Policy definitions


- `Deploy default Microsoft IaaSAntimalware extension for Windows Server` -	This policy deploys a Microsoft IaaSAntimalware extension with a default configuration when a VM is not configured with the antimalware extension.
- `Microsoft IaaSAntimalware extension should be deployed on Windows servers` - This policy audits any Windows server VM without Microsoft IaaSAntimalware extension deployed.
- `Only approved VM extensions should be installed` - This policy governs the virtual machine extensions that are not approved.
- `Managed disks should be double encrypted with both platform-managed and customer-managed keys` - High security sensitive customers who are concerned of the risk associated with any particular encryption algorithm, implementation, or key being compromised can opt for additional layer of encryption using a different encryption algorithm/mode at the infrastructure layer using platform managed encryption keys. The disk encryption sets are required to use double encryption. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/disks-doubleEncryption](https://aka.ms/disks-doubleEncryption).
- `Managed disks should use a specific set of disk encryption sets for the customer-managed key encryption` - Requiring a specific set of disk encryption sets to be used with managed disks give you control over the keys used for encryption at rest. You are able to select the allowed encrypted sets and all others are rejected when attached to a disk. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/disks-cmk](https://aka.ms/disks-cmk).
- `Microsoft Antimalware for Azure should be configured to automatically update protection signatures` - This policy audits any Windows virtual machine not configured with automatic update of Microsoft Antimalware protection signatures.
- `OS and data disks should be encrypted with a customer-managed key` - Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your managed disks. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with platform-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/disks-cmk](https://aka.ms/disks-cmk).
- `Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled` - Use encryption at host to get end-to-end encryption for your virtual machine and virtual machine scale set data. Encryption at host enables encryption at rest for your temporary disk and OS/data disk caches. Temporary and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted with platform-managed keys when encryption at host is enabled. OS/data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed key, depending on the encryption type selected on the disk. Learn more at [https://aka.ms/vm-hbe](https://aka.ms/vm-hbe).
- `Require automatic OS image patching on Virtual Machine Scale Sets` - This policy enforces enabling automatic OS image patching on Virtual Machine Scale Sets to always keep virtual Machines secure by safely applying latest security patches every month.

## Cost optimization

To optimize costs, review the [design principles](../cost-optimization/principles.md).

To estimate costs related to virtual machines, use these tools.

- Identify the best VM for your workloads with the virtual machines selector. For more information, see [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/)and [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/) pricing.
- Use this [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/#virtual-machines) to configure and estimate the costs of your Azure VMs.

### Design considerations
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Shut down VM instances which aren't in use.
> - Use [Spot VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/spot-vms) when appropriate.
> - Choose the right [VM size](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) for your workload.
> - Use [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) to secure operational access to the workload VMs.
> - Use a Premium SSD v2 disk and, based on your workload patterns, programmatically adjust its performance to account for either higher or lower demand.
> - For other disk types, size your disks to achieve your desired performance without the need for over-provisioning. Account for fluctuating workload patterns, and minimizing unused provisioned capacity.
> - Use [Zone to Zone disaster recovery](/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-zone-to-zone-disaster-recovery) for virtual machines.
> - Prepay for [reserved instances](/azure/virtual-machines/prepay-reserved-vm-instances) or an [Azure savings plan for compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/savings-plan-compute/#benefits-and-features) for significant azure-db-postgresqlvirtual-machinessavings.
> - Use hybrid benefit licensing.
> - Deploy [Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) to collect monitoring data from the guest operating system.

### Recommendations

Explore the following table of recommendations to optimize your Virtual Machine configuration for service cost:

|Recommendation|Benefit|
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Stop VMs during off-hours | Configuring start and stop times will shut down instances that aren't in use. The feature is suitable as a low-cost automation option. |
| Use Spot VMs when appropriate.|Spot VMs are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as highly parallel batch processing jobs. These VMs take advantage of the surplus capacity in Azure at a lower cost. They're also well suited for experimenting, developing, and testing large-scale solutions. Check out our [Azure Virtual Machine Spot Eviction](/azure/architecture/guide/spot/spot-eviction) guide to learn how to create a reliable interruptible workload in Azure.|
|Right-size your VMs |  Identify the best VM for your workloads with the virtual machines selector. See [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/) and [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) pricing.|
|Configure Azure Bastion for operational access | [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview#pricing) is charged on a fix per-hour basis, and charges for outbound data transfers. |
|Utilize Premium SSD v2 effectively | Premium SSD v2 allows you to granularly adjust your performance independent of the disk's size. Combining this adjustment ability with an understanding workload patterns, offers an effective cost optimization strategy for IaaS infrastructure, enabling high performance without excessive over-provisioning and minimizing the cost of unused capacity. |
| Optimize with managed disks | Determine your performance needs in combination with your storage capacity needs, accounting for fluctuating workload patterns. Knowing your needs allows you to determine what disk type and disk size you need. Some higher performance disk types offer extra cost optimization features and strategies. |
|Prepay for added cost savings | Purchasing [reserved instances](/azure/virtual-machines/prepay-reserved-vm-instances) is a way to reduce Azure costs for workloads with stable usage. Make sure you manage usage. If usage is too low, then you're paying for resources that aren't used. Keep reserved instances simple and keep management overhead low to prevent increasing cost.|
| Use existing licensing through the hybrid benefit licensing program | Hybrid benefit licensing is available for both [Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/azure-hybrid-benefit-linux) and [Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/hybrid-use-benefit-licensing)|
| Deploy AMA | AMA supports Data Collection Rules (DCR) which allow filtering rules and data transformation to reduce overall data volume being uploaded, which lowers ingestion and storage costs.|
