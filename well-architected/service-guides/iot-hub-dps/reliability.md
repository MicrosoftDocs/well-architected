# IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and reliability

The [IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](/azure/iot-dps/) is a helper service for IoT Hub. DPS enables zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to the right IoT Hub without requiring human intervention. IoT Hub DPS allows customers to provision millions of devices in a secure and scalable manner.
