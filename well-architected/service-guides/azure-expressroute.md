# Architecture best practices for Azure ExpressRoute

Azure ExpressRoute enables you to create private connections between Azure data-centers and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet, offering more security, faster speeds, and lower latencies than typical internet connections. 

This article assumes that you have working knowledge of Azure ExpressRoute and are well versed with all of its features. The guidance in this article provides architectural recommendations that are mapped to the principles of the [Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars](/azure/well-architected/pillars).

### Technology scope

This review focuses on the interrelated decisions for the following Azure resources:  

- Azure ExpressRoute

## Reliability

The purpose of the Reliability pillar is to provide continued functionality by **building enough resilience and the ability
to recover fast from failures**.

Highly reliable, resilient, and available network connections are fundamental to a well-structured system. Reliability consists of two principles: *resiliency* and *availability*. Resiliency aims to prevent failures and, if they occur, to restore applications to a fully operational state. Availability ensures consistent access to your applications or workloads. It's important to proactively plan for reliability based on your business needs and application requirements.

The [**Reliability design principles**](/azure/well-architected/resiliency/principles) provide a high-level design strategy applied for individual components, system flows, and the system as a whole.

### Design checklist

Start your design strategy based on the [design review checklist for Reliability](../reliability/checklist.md). Determine its relevance to your business requirements while keeping in mind the features and capabilities of Azure ExpressRoute. Extend the strategy to include more approaches as needed.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - **Build redundancy, strengthen resiliency:** Eliminate single points of failure as much as practical. Plan for redundancy in the network design by configuring multiple ExpressRoute circuits, diverse paths, and multiple peering locations closest to your on-premises locations.
> Define availability and recovery targets for the components, the flows, and the overall solution. Visualize the targets to negotiate, gain consensus, set expectations, and drive actions to achieve the ideal state.
>
> - **Anticipate potential failures:** Plan mitigation strategies for potential failures. The following table shows examples of failure mode analysis.
>
>   | Failure | Mitigation |
>   |---|---|
>   | Circuit disruption, such as hardware failure at a peering location. | Have a secondary circuit for redundancy while service is restored.  Monitor the health of the circuit to identify when there might be issues. |
>   | Gateway disruption in the Azure virtual networks. | Have your gateway deployed in multiple availability zones, and with Active/Active configuration so that the disruption of the gateway in a single zone does not prevent connectivity. |
>
> - **Plan for site resiliency:** Planning for site resiliency is crucial to ensure high availability. ExpressRoute offers three architectures of site resiliency: *Standard*, *High*, and *Maximum*. Standard resiliency provides basic protection against link failures, but does not provide protection against site failures. High resiliency offers enhanced protection with additional failover mechanisms, and Maximum resiliency ensures the highest level of protection with multiple redundant systems and failover mechanisms.
>
> - **Plan for regions and availability zones:** Plan for multiple region and availability zones closest to your on-premises locations to provide resiliency and high availability.
>
> - **Plan for ExpressRoute circuit or ExpressRoute Direct:** During the initial planning phase, you want to decide whether you want to configure an ExpressRoute circuit or an ExpressRoute Direct connection.
>
> - **Choose the right circuit SKU:** ExpressRoute circuit SKUs provide redundancy through the use of geographic expansion. ExpressRoute have three SKUs: Local, Standard, and Premium.
>
>    | SKU          | Geographic Expansion                                           | Redundancy                        | Use Case                                                      |
>    |--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
>    | Local        | Access to Azure regions within or near the same metro area.     | Localized redundancy              | High-speed, low-latency connections within a metro area.       |
>    | Standard     | Access to all Azure regions within a specific geopolitical area.| Regional redundancy               | Broader regional connectivity needs.                           |
>    | Premium      | Global connectivity to any Azure region worldwide.              | Global redundancy                 | Extensive geographic reach for global operations.              |
>
> - **Plan for Active-Active connectivity:** ExpressRoute dedicated circuits provide availability when an active-active connectivity is configured between on-premises and Azure. This configuration provides higher availability of your ExpressRoute connection.
>
> - **Plan for geo-redundant circuits:** Configure ExpressRoute circuits in more than one peering location to ensure that there are multiple, geographically diverse paths between on-premises networks and Azure. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure causing a network outage, thereby increasing the reliability and availability of the connection.
>
> - **Configure ExpressRoute Global Reach:** As an ExpressRoute circuit Premium SKU feature, ExpressRoute Global Reach allows you to link your on-premises networks across different geographical locations directly through the Azure backbone network. By connecting your on-premises networks to multiple Azure regions, Global Reach provides an additional layer of redundancy. If one Azure region becomes unavailable, you can quickly reroute traffic to another region without relying on the public internet, maintaining secure and reliable connectivity.
>
> - **Configure site-to-site VPN as a backup to ExpressRoute private peering:** This configuration provides an additional layer of redundancy and ensures that your network remains operational even if the ExpressRoute connection experiences an outage.
>
> - **Plan for Virtual Network Gateways:** When selecting and configuring your ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway for resiliency, consider the following best practices:
>
>    - Select the right ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway SKU to reflect the correct performance and throughput for your business.
>
>    - Configure ExpressRoute Gateways in different regions for regional redundancy & resiliency.
>
>    - Configure zone-redundant Virtual Network Gateway within Availability Zones for zone redundancy and resiliency.
>
>    - Deploy scalable Virtual Network Gateways that allow auto-scale based on your required throughput.
>  
> - **Plan for service providers:** Choose different service providers for each circuit to ensure diverse paths. This diversity in service providers minimizes the risk of network downtime due to a single provider's outage.
>
> - **Conduct reliability testing:** Test the network design for resiliency to ensure that the network can withstand failures. Testing can be achieved by using Azure Connectivity Toolkit to test performance across your ExpressRoute circuit to understand bandwidth capacity and latency of your network connection. Confirm failover mechanisms are working as expected.
>
> - **Configure monitoring for ExpressRoute circuits and ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway health:** Configure monitoring and alerts for ExpressRoute circuit and ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway health based on various metrics available.
>
> - **Use health indicators to identify disruptions:** Configure monitoring and alerts for ExpressRoute circuit and ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway health based on various metrics available.

### Recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|--------|----|
| Anticipate and mitigate potential failures when you [design and architect Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/design-architecture-for-resiliency). | Anticipating failures leads to the design of a more robust and resilient network architecture that can withstand various failure scenarios. |
| [Plan for site resiliency](/azure/expressroute/design-architecture-for-resiliency). For [Maximum](/azure/expressroute/design-architecture-for-resiliency#maximum-resiliency) or [High](/azure/expressroute/design-architecture-for-resiliency#high-resiliency) resiliency, plan to have multiple paths between the on-premises edge and the peering locations (provider/Microsoft edge locations). For Maximum Resiliency, [configure multiple circuits to different peering locations](/azure/expressroute/designing-for-high-availability-with-expressroute#first-mile-physical-layer-design-considerations). For High Resiliency, configure a circuit between multiple peering locations within the same metropolitan area (also referred to as ExpressRoute Metro) from the on-premises network. | By having multiple paths between the on-premises edge and the peering locations, the network can continue to operate even if one path fails. This redundancy is crucial for maintaining continuous connectivity and minimizing downtime. |
| Plan for multiple [region and availability zones](/azure/reliability/overview#regions-and-availability-zones).  | Availability zones are physically separate locations within a region, providing fault isolation. This means that failures in one zone don't affect the others, enhancing overall system reliability. |
| Plan for [ExpressRoute circuit](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-circuit-peerings#circuits) or [ExpressRoute Direct](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-erdirect-about). During the initial planning phase, you want to decide whether you want to configure an ExpressRoute circuit or an ExpressRoute Direct connection. You also need to identify the bandwidth requirement and the SKU type requirement for your business needs. | An ExpressRoute circuit allows a private dedicated connection into Azure with the help of a connectivity provider. ExpressRoute Direct allows you to extend on-premises network directly into the Microsoft network at a peering location. |
| Choose the right circuit SKU for redundancy by using geographic expansion. The [Local, Standard, and Premium SKUs](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs#expressroute-sku-scope-access) offer different levels of connectivity, access, and performance capabilities. Premium SKU provides the highest level of redundancy with global connectivity to any Azure region worldwide. | Choosing the right circuit SKU ensures that you have the appropriate level of redundancy and connectivity for your workloads.  |
| [Plan for Active-Active connectivity](/azure/expressroute/designing-for-high-availability-with-expressroute#active-active-connections). To improve high availability, redundancy, and resiliency, we recommend operating both connections of an ExpressRoute circuit in active-active mode. Additionally, configure [Bi-Directional Forwarding Detection (BFD)](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-bfd) over both private and Microsoft Peering for faster failover during a link failure. | Active-active mode mode provides higher availability of your ExpressRoute connections. BFD provides rapid detection of link failures, enabling quicker failover to backup paths. This minimizes downtime and ensures continuous connectivity. |
| Plan for [geo-redundant circuits](/azure/expressroute/designing-for-disaster-recovery-with-expressroute-privatepeering).  | There are scenarios where an ExpressRoute peering location or an entire regional service might experience degradation. Geo-redundancy enhances disaster recovery and high availability by ensuring that there are multiple, geographically diverse paths between on-premises networks and Azure. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure causing a network outage, thereby increasing the reliability and availability of the connection. |
| With [ExpressRoute Global Reach](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach) you can link ExpressRoute circuits together to make a private network between your on-premises networks. [Configure ExpressRoute Global Reach](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-set-global-reach) on your ExpressRoute circuit Premium SKU.  | ExpressRoute Global Reach provides an additional layer of redundancy by linking your on-premises networks across different geographical locations directly through the Azure backbone network. This ensures that your network remains connected and operational even if one Azure region becomes unavailable. |
| Choose different [ExpressRoute service providers](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-locations-providers) for each circuit. | Diversity in service providers minimizes the risk of network downtime due to a single provider's outage. By choosing different service providers for each circuit, you can ensure that your network remains operational even if one provider experiences an outage. This redundancy is essential for maintaining continuous connectivity and minimizing downtime.|
| Configure [Site-to-Site VPN over Microsoft peering](/azure/expressroute/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering) as a backup to ExpressRoute private peering. Site-to-site VPN provides an additional layer of redundancy and ensures that your network remains operational even if the ExpressRoute connection experiences an outage. |  By configuring a site-to-site VPN as a backup to ExpressRoute private peering, you can maintain continuous connectivity and minimize downtime. |
| Planning for [zone-redundant Virtual Network Gateways](/azure/vpn-gateway/about-zone-redundant-vnet-gateways). Select the right [ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway SKU](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#gwsku) to reflect the correct performance and throughput for your business. Consider deploying a [scalable virtual network gateway](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#expressroute-scalable-gateway-preview) that allows you to achieve 40-Gbps connectivity and will auto-scale based on your required throughput.  Deploy ExpressRoute virtual network gateways that are [zone-redundant](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#zrgw) for maximum resiliency and redundancy across Availability Zones.| Choosing the appropriate SKU ensures that the gateway can handle the required performance and throughput for your business needs. A scalable virtual network gateway autoscales based on required throughput, allowing the network to adapt to changing demands. This flexibility helps maintain performance during peak usage times and prevents overloading. Additionally, deploying zone-redundant virtual network gateways ensures that the network remains operational even if one availability zone experiences an outage, enhancing overall reliability and resiliency.   |
| Conduct [reliability testing](/azure/expressroute/evaluate-circuit-resiliency) with the [Azure Connectivity Toolkit](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-troubleshooting-network-performance#azurect---the-azure-connectivity-toolkit) to ensure that the network design is resilient and can withstand failures. | Reliability testing helps identify potential issues and weaknesses in the network design, allowing you to address them proactively. By conducting reliability testing, you can ensure that the network is robust and resilient, minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous connectivity. |
| Configure [monitoring and alerts](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute) for ExpressRoute [circuits](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressroutecircuits), [peering](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressroutecircuitspeerings), [ports](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressrouteports), and [Virtual Network Gateway](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressroutegateways) resource health based on various available metrics. This helps in proactively managing and maintaining the health of your network. Use [Network Insights](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-network-insights) for ExpressRoute to visualize topological maps and health dashboards, providing a clear view of your configurations and their status. | By setting up monitoring and alerts based on various metrics, you can proactively detect and address issues such as increased latency, traffic drops, or circuit downtimes before they impact your services. |
| [Configure service health](/azure/expressroute/maintenance-alerts) to notify you about planned and unplanned maintenance. Configuring service health notifies you about changes made to your ExpressRoute circuits. | With Service Health, you can view planned and past maintenance in the Azure portal along with configuring alerts and notifications that best suits your needs. |

### Recommendations

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|--------|----|
| Familiarize yourself with [ExpressRoute pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/expressroute/). Use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate the cost. ExpressRoute Direct has a monthly port fee that includes the circuit fee for Local and Standard SKU ExpressRoute circuits. For Premium SKU circuits, there's an additional circuit fee. Outbound data transfer is charged per GB used, depending on the zone number of the peering location. The outbound data charge applies only to Standard and Premium SKUs. For more information, see [plan and manage costs for Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/plan-manage-cost). | Understanding ExpressRoute pricing enables better cost management, informed decision-making, avoidance of unexpected charges and maximization of value. |
| Determine [circuit SKU and bandwidth](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-circuit-peerings) required. The way you're charged for your ExpressRoute usage varies between the three different SKU types. With the Local SKU, you're automatically charged with an Unlimited data plan. With the Standard and Premium SKUs, you can choose between a Metered or an Unlimited data plan. All ingress data is free of charge, except when using the Global Reach add-on, which incurs additional costs for data transfer between different geographical locations. It's important to review and [resize your ExpressRoute circuit](/azure/expressroute/about-upgrade-circuit-bandwidth).  | It's important to understand which SKU types and data plan works best for your workload to best optimize cost and budget. |
| Determine the size of the  [ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#gwsku). ExpressRoute virtual network gateways are used to pass traffic into a virtual network over private peering. Select the appropriate gateway SKU on your on-premises to Azure workload. Understand ExpressRoute Gateway pricing based on region and type. ExpressRoute Gateways are charged at an hourly rate plus the cost of an ExpressRoute circuit. Configure [scalable ExpressRoute gateways](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#expressroute-scalable-gateway-preview) to set minimum and maximum scale units for the gateway, which auto-scales based on active bandwidth or flow count. See [ExpressRoute pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/expressroute/) and select ExpressRoute Gateways to see rates for different gateway SKUs. | This benefits you by enabling right-sizing of resources, providing flexibility to scale, optimizing performance, and supporting proactive cost management. This approach ensures that you're using resources efficiently and cost-effectively.|
| [Monitor costs and create budget alerts](/azure/expressroute/plan-manage-cost#monitor-costs). Monitor the cost of your ExpressRoute circuit and create alerts for spending anomalies and overspending risks. | Monitoring and alerts provide you with tools to control spending, enhance financial planning, ensure accountability, and optimize resource usage. |

The toolkit includes tools to optimize network performance, ensuring efficient and reliable connectivity to Azure services. |
| Plan for scaling of ExpressRoute circuits. [Upgrade your ExpressRoute circuit bandwidth](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#upgrade) to meet your production workload requirements. Circuit bandwidth is shared between all virtual networks connected to the ExpressRoute circuit. Depending on your workload, one or more virtual networks can use up all the bandwidth on the circuit. For more information, see [ExpressRoute limits](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-faqs#limits).  | Upgrading the bandwidth ensures that the network can handle increasing data volumes and more users without compromising performance. |
| Plan for scaling of ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway. [Upgrade your ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway SKU](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways) to meet your production workload requirements. | Upgrading to a larger gateway SKU provides higher throughput capabilities, allowing more data to be transferred between on-premises networks and Azure more quickly. A larger gateway can manage more simultaneous connections and higher volumes of traffic, reducing the likelihood of network congestion and bottlenecks. |
| Configure [Scalable Gateways](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways#expressroute-scalable-gateway-preview) to automatically scale for performance. | Scalable Gateways allows you to scale up and down automatically with your gateway instances to accommodate performance needs. ErGwScale SKU also enables you to achieve 40-Gbps connectivity to virtual machines and Private Endpoints within the virtual network. |
| Enable [ExpressRoute FastPath](/azure/expressroute/about-fastpath) for higher throughput on your virtual network gateway.  | This feature improves the data path performance between your on-premises network and your virtual network resources by bypassing the gateway. As business needs grow, FastPath provides the necessary bandwidth and performance to support increasing data volumes and more users without compromising performance. Enabling FastPath ensures that the network can handle future expansions and new applications, providing long-term performance efficiency. |
| Monitor [Monitor ExpressRoute circuit, port, and gateway metrics](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute). Configure alerts for ExpressRoute metrics to proactively notify you when a certain threshold is met. [ExpressRoute circuit metrics](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressroutecircuits) supports metrics such as Arp Availability, BitsInPerSecond, DroppedInBitsPerSecond. [ExpressRoute port metrics](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressrouteports) supports metrics such as AdminState, BitsInPerSecond, and FastPathRoutesCount. [ExpressRoute Gateway metrics](/azure/expressroute/monitor-expressroute-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftnetworkexpressroutegateways) supports metrics such as Bits In Per Second, Active Flows, and Count Of Routes Advertised to Peer. </br> Monitor performance targets with [Connection Monitor](/azure/network-watcher/connection-monitor-overview). | ExpressRoute circuit, port, and gateway metrics are useful to understand anomalies that can happen with your ExpressRoute connection such as outages and maintenance happening to your ExpressRoute circuits. Connection Monitor can detect networking issues by identifying where along the network path the problem is and help you quickly resolve configuration or hardware failures. |

## Azure Policy

Azure Policy doesn't provide any built-in policies for ExpressRoute, but custom policies can be created to help govern how ExpressRoute circuits should match your desired end state, such as SKU choice, peering type, peering configurations and so on.
