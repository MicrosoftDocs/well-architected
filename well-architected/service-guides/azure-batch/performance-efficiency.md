# Azure Batch and performance efficiency

[Azure Batch](/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview) allows you to run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs efficiently in Azure.

Use Azure Batch to:

- Create and manage a pool of compute nodes (virtual machines).
- Install applications you want to run.
- Schedule jobs to run on the compute nodes.

The following sections include a design checklist and recommended design options specific to Azure Batch.

## Design checklist

**Have you designed your workload and configured Azure Batch with performance efficiency in mind?**

> - Use fewer jobs and more tasks.

## Design and configuration recommendations

Consider the following recommendation to optimize your workload design and Azure Batch configuration for performance efficiency:

|Recommendation|Description|
|------------------|------------|
|Use fewer jobs and more tasks.|Using a job to run a single task is inefficient. For example, it's more efficient to use a single job containing `1000` tasks rather than creating `100` jobs that contain `10` tasks each. Running `1000` jobs, each with a single task, would be the least efficient, slowest, and most expensive approach.|
