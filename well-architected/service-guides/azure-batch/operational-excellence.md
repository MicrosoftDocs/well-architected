# Azure Batch and operational excellence

[Azure Batch](/azure/batch/batch-technical-overview) allows you to run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs efficiently in Azure.

Use Azure Batch to:

- Create and manage a pool of compute nodes (virtual machines).
- Install applications you want to run.
- Schedule jobs to run on the compute nodes.

The following sections include a design and configuration checklist, recommended design, and configuration options specific to Azure Batch.

## Design and configuration checklist

**Have you designed your workload and configured Azure Batch with operational excellence in mind?**
***

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Keep application binaries and reference data up to date in all regions.
> - Use fewer jobs and more tasks.
> - Pre-create all required services in each region, such as the Batch account and storage account.
> - Make sure the appropriate quotas are set on all subscriptions ahead of time, so you can allocate the required number of cores using the Batch account.

## Design and configuration recommendations

Explore the following table of recommendations to optimize your workload design and Azure Batch configuration for operational excellence:

|Recommendation|Description|
|------------------|------------|
|Keep application binaries and reference data up to date in all regions.|Staying up to date will ensure the region can be brought online quickly without waiting for file upload and deployment.|
|Use fewer jobs and more tasks.|Using a job to run a single task is inefficient. For example, it's more efficient to use a single job containing `1000` tasks rather than creating `100` jobs that contain `10` tasks each. Running `1000` jobs, each with a single task, would be the least efficient, slowest, and most expensive approach.|
|Pre-create all required services in each region, such as the Batch account and storage account.|There's often no charge for creating accounts and charges accrue only when you use the account, or when you store data.|
