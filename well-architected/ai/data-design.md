# Data design for AI workloads on Azure

- Structuring data in order to work with large language models
- Types of search
  - Vector
  - Full Text
  - Keywords
- Chunking and Ingestion of data
- Optimizing data stores for how AI models search them
- Protecting user data
- Monitoring (required)

## Optimize indexing techniques

 There might be slow response times when querying a vector database. The root cause is often inadequate indexing.

## Searching the database

## Types of data

There could be training data is used to build and train machine learning models. There's also  user data that includes information generated by users during interactions with the application. Each type has it's own requirements (prpocessing, storage, and retrieval).
