# Data design for AI workloads on Azure

- Structuring data in order to work with large language models
- Types of search
  - Vector
  - Full Text
  - Keywords
- Chunking and Ingestion of data
- Optimizing data stores for how AI models search them
- Protecting user data
- Monitoring (required)

## Optimize indexing techniques

 There might be slow response times when querying a vector database. The root cause is often inadequate indexing.

## Searching the database

## Types of data

There could be training data is used to build and train machine learning models. There's also  user data that includes information generated by users during interactions with the application. Each type has it's own requirements (prpocessing, storage, and retrieval).

## Elisabeth's (SME & area lead) seed material

 1. Data Modeling
   
	Which language is used? Single language index easier for quality control. 
	
	What is special about this data? Is standard index good enough, or do I need custom index fields with meta information and SME index fields? E.G. a patent search use case needs more index fields than a plain chat with my website. Are there technical terms I want to filter on?
	
	What are the most common questions on this data?
	
	Do you have questions & expected answers pairs created, for testing the quality of the chat system?
	
	For Talk to your SQL:
	Do all tables and columns contain relevant comments and meta information helping the LLM to choos the right column in the SQL statements ?

	• Types of search
		○ Vector 
		○ Full Text
		○ Keywords
	
	Semantic search most performant when customer creates custom index fields with relevant data (in most trival case document title and chunk's subsection header, as highly relevant keywords are usually in  title and header, but standart chunking strategies cut of this information)
	
	When using keyword part of AI Search, be aware it is more language dependent than vector search ( standartize documents of different input language into english for best chunk retrieval performance, than back translate to user language)
	
 2. Data Roles and Responsibilities
   
	Who inside the company is responsible and SME for this data? 
	
	Does the data set contain confidential data? Are some data sets restricted to certrain people within the company? Is the information about the role based access available in source system (like Sharepoint)? Is this information stored in extra index field to allow AAD driven filtering of content?
	
	
 3. Data System Design
   
	Customized chat solutions offer high value when data from different sources is combined, e.g. plain text files from different sources ( Blob storage, Sharepoint, websites, …), SQL DBs, bing search,
	
	How to syncronize content? Especially with large content ( >100 GB) standard processes do not instantaniously update information

4. Data Quality / Chunking and Ingestion of data
	
Has there been a data quality assessment before indexing the content ( Garbage in , garbage out remains true with LLMs)
	
Many companies keep outdated information for the sake of completeness / auditing within the main data source. Do outdated files contain meta tags for not-indexing?
	
Version control of documents?
	
Is there a method implemented for removing outdated content from index? Either with auto indexer, or custom removal? ( Use blob storage instead of ADSL Gen2, as latter does not support native blbo soft)
	
Sometimes AI Search does not deliver good chunks because no relevant key word is listed in the document.
Is there an evaluation process determining when to improve indexing techniques, and when to improve data quality of input files (SEO) ?
	
Data duplication skews index quality, as some content is found too often
	
Best practises for tables ? 
Extract tables with document intelligence, and store as JSON ?
Create table text describtion using GPT 4 vision models, and embed / vectorize table description for AI Search
	
Images ? Extract images in data preparation pipeline and create image embedding and image description
	
	
	
	

5. Data Governance
	
Data modeling or platform topic?

6.  Data / LLM Education
	
Do user get an introduction on the the expected quality of the chat system, the likelyhood that AI creates wrong content, and limitation of what kind of questions can be answered?
	
Standart RAG architecture cannot answer questions like "how many documents have this feature?" Consider a GraphRAG architecture instead
	
	
7.  Data Compliance
	
Are meta prompts implemented? See System message framework and template recommendations for Large Language Models(LLMs) - Azure OpenAI Service | Microsoft Learn for details![image](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/well-architected-pr/assets/89789134/9e39f543-6636-4d97-8901-fef79f2ef2a5)
