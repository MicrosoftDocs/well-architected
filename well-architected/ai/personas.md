# Workload personas involved in AI workloads

An organization has several roles that participate in workload functions. One team's responsibility might be training the ML model while another team might consume it. In other case, you have a team who consume a finished model and customize it.

Securing data could be coming from a workload or multiple workload teams.

## Joakim Åström's (SME & area lead) seed material
- Connect the E2E process (MLOps, LLMOps, pretrained AI) with personas - where in the process are the personas active. IMAGE=yes
- Connect personas with known example roles and example departments for customers to be familiar, and to get orientation of the personas - where they live in their org. IMAGE=yes
- Do not focus on outlier personas, apply 80/20 rule, and focus on the personas real customers have. No utopia personas - verify customer references.
- Provide user stories to give examples of stories with personas in use.
- Sort all use cases & personas within the AI umbrella: Pretrained AI, Discriminative AI, Generative AI. IMAGE=yes
