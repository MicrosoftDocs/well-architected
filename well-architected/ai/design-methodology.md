# Design methodology for AI workloads on Azure

When you design AI workloads, you integrate code and data to replace deterministic behavior, enabling tasks like prediction, classification, and other functional goals. AI workload architecture can often be complex and must be designed within business constraints. While the Well-Architected Framework provides a solid foundation for architectural excellence, AI-specific design principles should also be considered.

This article presents a suggested design methodology centered around those AI principles, which systematically guide the design and optimization of solutions. When uncertain in decision making, refer back to this methodology to **emphasize design direction through high-level AI principles**. If you're designing a capability or introducing an improvement, evaluate the change from the methodology perspective. Is safe user experience affected? Is it flexible enough to adapt to future innovations? Will it disrupt the experimentation flow? Another benefit of the methodology is collaboration with product owners and stakeholders to justify technical decisions.

## Design with an experimental mindset

Designing with an experimental mindset **targets achieving relevancy through iterative and statistically-driven processes** based on real-world use cases.

Experimentation in AI involves continuous adjustments with measurable results against quality targets after each iteration. An experimentation loop is necessary during the initial model evaluation and ongoing refinement. The inner loop refines the model's predictive power in the development environment, while the outer loop monitors production usage and can trigger further refinement or data preparation. Both loops rely on continuous monitoring and evaluation to identify improvements.

Not every experiment succeeds. Consider worst-case scenarios and have contingency plans for failed experiments.

## Design responsibly

When users interact with your AI system, they place their **trust in its ethical functionality**, despite the opaque logic of AI models. This trust holds you accountable for designing the system to prevent unethical behaviors such as manipulation, content toxicity, IP infringement, and fabricated responses. Responsible AI should be embedded not only in systems operations but also in the culture of the team. The practices must extend throughout the lifecycle of user interactionâ€”from the user's initial intent to use the system, during sessions, and even during disruptions caused by system errors.

Content moderation is a key strategy in responsible design of generative AI, where requests and responses are evaluated in real-time to ensure safety and appropriateness. As part of the experimentation loops, strive to make algorithms fair and inclusive to minimize bias. Bias can enter the system through various channels, including during actual sessions or when gathering feedback.

Ethical data management is central to responsible design, involving careful decisions about when to use or avoid relying on user data. Users trust you to ensure that any personal information is either removed from the system or retained only with their consent. If retention is inevitable, ensure data is protected with trusted technology for privacy and security.

## Design for explainability

AI model results must be explainable, requiring **justification and tracing of data origins, inference processes, and the journey of data** from source to the serve layer. In discriminative AI, decisions can be justified with each step, while explainability in generative models can be complex. Documenting the decision-making process, both manually and through technical capabilities, is essential.

The objective of this principle is to ensure the system's transparency and accountability to gain user's trust.

## Stay ahead of model decay

Model decay is a unique challenge in AI that significantly impacts design decisions. The **quality of AI model outputs can deteriorate** over time without any changes to the code, sometimes even suddenly, due to changes in data or external factors.

This deterioration affects various aspects of the system. This includes data ingestion speed, data quality, monitoring needs, evaluation processes, and reaction times to correct issues. Early detection is recommended through a combination of automated processes for continuous monitoring and model evaluation. User feedback is also an effective method for identifying model decay.

Regardless of the signals used to identify model decay, the operations team must engage data scientists to promptly research and address potential decay issues.

## Design for adaptability

AI is advancing at a rapid pace in terms of technological advancement and adoption. Be aware that **what you build today might become obsolete quickly**, impacting design decisions and processes.

This principle emphasizes the need for **agility and flexibility**, recognizing that some components may have a shorter lifespan. Adopt a *pause-and-think* approach where thorough research of model discovery, programming libraries and frameworks, and processing technologies is key.
