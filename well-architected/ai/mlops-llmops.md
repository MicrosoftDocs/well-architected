### Client in the insurance industry
#### Intro
-	Situation:
Ferrero Group is one of the world’s largest sweet-packaged food companies, with over 35 iconic brands sold in more than 170 countries. The most famous words associated with Ferrero Group include Nutella, Kinder, Tic Tac, and Ferrero Rocher. With more than 47,000 employees, the Ferrero Group’s family culture, now in its third generation, is based on dedication to quality and excellence, heritage, and a commitment to the planet's health.
Our primary contact, Christophe, is a smart Enterprise Architect and a direct report of the CIO; part of his job is to collect the internal opportunities to attach AI to their challenges, formalize the requirements, analyze, and finally choose their partners’ proposals.
By the beginning of FY24, our CSAM approached him to start discussing an evolution of the traditional delivery of the Unified Support contract, offering a deeper understanding of the opportunities offered by our AI services.
-	Use cases:
When I met Christophe and started an open discussion with him, he explained to me the two main challenges he was facing:
1.	He lacked the necessary awareness to objectively analyze the three AI projects that he had approved with some partners of ours.
2.	His internal business stakeholders had always been rather cautious about the actual effectiveness of such projects, influenced by the multitude of technologies available today on the AI market, possible security implications, and other concerns..

Due to these reasons, a classical program based on a series of dedicated technical meetings as we’re used to doing with many other (more mature and committed) Customers could not be proposed at the moment. However, we agreed on proceeding with a double-faced approach:
1.	One-on-one work between Christophe and me to analyze the three current projects, starting from the high level solution proposed by each partner followed by the architecture, technologies and frameworks chosen for the implementation. This allowed to identify, with a top down approach, the skills that Christophe should have gained to become more aware of the ongoing project gaps, risks and current status: in a serie of dedicated sessions made of theory, architecture and hands-on tasks, we implemented a sort of “training on the job” approach which made him more confident of investing in something that could be immediately put in practice, as he did.
2.	Creation of an internal culture that explained, at a higher level, the opportunities and investments that the whole Company was doing in the AI area, with the goal of creating the awareness and confidence to stimulate more ideas. 

#### Recommendations (Ways to achieve the best outcome)
As explained, we had to implement a dedicated approach; however, I think that this kind of situation is not uncommon nowadays. This is how we implemented it:
-	On his side, the Customer engaged the internal HR division to identify the right internal department stakholders to attend a consistent workshop that exaplained the most recent technologies and allowed people to share any concerns and ask questions collected so far. 
-	On my side, I worked to build a customized workshop agenda and contents with the proper balance of theory, architecture and practice. It was a big investment and a challenge, being aware that we created very high expection and asked a consistent investment to dedicate fifty managers to spend four hours with us: a second opportunity would have been quite impossible in the near future.

I delivered this workshop on May 30th, 2024. Not a single person left the meeting before the end, a lot of questions were asked and several enthusiastic feedbacks where shared in the meeting chat and in the survey that followed the event. Furthermore, despite the whole meeting was recorded, a second session of this event was required to be re-delivered for other colleagues on June 20th, 2024. I’m reporting these feedbacks just to confirm that this investment was considered helpful by the Customer in this specific situation. So I’m happy to share this experience with the team and more practically the workshop slides and demos, plus the material associated to the more technical sessions.
