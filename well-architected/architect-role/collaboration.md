# Collaboration with the workload team

Delivering architecture specifications isn't a one-off task. An architect should expect to engage with the workload team throughout the implementation.

## Continuous collaboration tasks

- **Provide clarity**. Architects should be readily available to provide clarity on any delivered specifications to ensure that implementation teams remain unblocked. To address potential blockers, architects should actively participate in iteration planning exercises and team meetings.

- **Make implementation sequencing suggestions**. Architects understand that the journey from design to a production-ready product is iterative. They can recommend which parts of the application to implement first. This approach enables the workload team to learn from that experience and apply the knowledge that they gain to the remaining parts of the workload.

- **Set implementation review checkpoints**. Workload teams should establish regular review checkpoints for comparing the implementation with the architectural specification. This practice helps ensure that the design is implemented according to the specification and that the specification meets the predicted requirements. This feedback loop can rectify any design or implementation errors.

- **Communicate with stakeholders**. Architects have an established relationship with stakeholders and the business and have an intimate understanding of the workload. As a result, they're often in a good position to relay implementation team concerns or requests for negotiating changes to requirements.

- **Make environment recommendations**. Workload design often extends beyond designing for production and its disaster recovery. Production is just one of many environments a workload implementation team might need. Architects can also assist workload teams in right-sizing preproduction environments.

- **Use a proof of concept (POC)**. Architects frequently use POCs in their designs to inform decisions about the design specifications for the workload architecture. These POCs can also provide insight into the feasibility of the actual workload implementation. If a POC doesn't exist, an architect should create one before the implementation team starts development.
