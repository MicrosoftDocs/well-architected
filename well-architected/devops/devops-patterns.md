# Operational Excellence patterns

Cloud applications run in a remote datacenter where you don't have full control of the infrastructure or, in some cases, the operating system. This situation can make management and monitoring more difficult than an on-premises deployment. Applications must expose runtime information that administrators and operators can use to manage and monitor the system. Applications must also support changing business requirements and customization without requiring the application to be stopped or redeployed.

|   [Health Endpoint Monitoring](/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring)   |   Implement functional checks in an application that external tools can access through exposed endpoints at regular intervals.    |
|   [Materialized View](/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view)   |   Generate prepopulated views over the data in one or more data stores when the data isn't ideally formatted for required query operations.    |
|                      [Sidecar](/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar)                      |         Deploy components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation.          |
