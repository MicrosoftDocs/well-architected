title: Mission-critical workload documentation
summary: Learn about building highly reliable workloads on Microsoft Azure. The articles provide architectural guidance and a prescriptive approach for designing, building, and operating mission-critical workloads. For a given set of business requirements, an application should always be operational and available. While there are many approaches to achieving high reliability, one of the goals is to accelerate adoption toward cloud native solutions to derive maximum value from the Microsoft Cloud.
