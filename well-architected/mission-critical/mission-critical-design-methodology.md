# Design methodology for mission-critical workloads on Azure

Designing a mission-critical application on any cloud platform demands deep technical expertise and a thoughtful engineering approach. The complexity spans multiple dimensions: understanding the platform's capabilities, selecting the right services, configuring them correctly, operationalizing them effectively, and staying aligned with evolving best practices and service roadmaps.

To navigate this complexity, establish a clear and simple design methodology that aligns with your business requirements, particularly around uptime and recovery. When decision-making becomes challenging or you find yourself stuck in analysis paralysis, return to your methodology as a reference point. It can help validate your choices, keep your design focused, and ensure alignment with your overall goals.

This article suggests a design methodology grounded in the Azure Well-Architected Framework. It's informed by insights gained from reviewing numerous mission-critical applications deployed on Azure across various organizations.

## Design for your reliability objectives


Mission citical doesn't mean the same for everyone. They vary in their reliability needs, which should be defined by business requirements and acceptable downtime. Selecting a target reliability tier, such as 99.9% vs. 99.999% availability, directly influences architectural decisions and tradeoffs. 

This design methodology encourages tailoring your architecture to the specific Service Level Objective (SLO). Consider availability SLOs to be more than just uptime. They represent consistent service relative to a healthy application state. As a starting point, teams should define how much downtime is acceptable. 

|Reliability (SLO)|Permitted Downtime (Week)|Permitted Downtime (Month)|Permitted Downtime (Year)|
|--|--|--|--|
|99.9%|10 minutes, 4 seconds|43 minutes, 49 seconds|8 hours, 45 minutes, 56 seconds|
|99.95%|5 minutes, 2 seconds|21 minutes, 54 seconds|4 hours, 22 minutes, 58 seconds|
|99.99%|1 minutes|4 minutes 22 seconds|52 minutes, 35 seconds|
|99.999%|6 seconds|26 seconds|5 minutes, 15 seconds|
|99.9999%|<1 second|2 seconds|31 seconds|

While a single-region, multi-zone setup may suffice for many critical workloads, higher reliability tiers demand significantly more engineering effort and complexity. Avoid defaulting to overly complex solutions like active-active multi-region unless truly necessary.

RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) are key to defining reliability needs. For example, if your goal is to recover an application in under a minute, backup-based or active-passive strategies likely won't be fast enough.

## Design for zero-downtime deployments

Zero-downtime deployments ensure users don't experience any disruption during updates. 

This methodology demands rigorous pre-release testing so that updates don't introduce defects, vulnerabilities, or instability. To support this, deployment tools and processes must be highly available and resilient. 

Consistency is also key: the same artifacts and automated processes should be used across all environments to eliminate any chance of manual errors and reduce overall risk. End-to-end automation is not just preferred; it's mandatory for achieving reliable, repeatable, and interruption-free deployments.

## Design for fast failure detection and recovery

Fast failure detection starts with a well-defined health model. Because failures often cascade across components, early detection and clear dependency between workload components is a non-negotiable for minimizing the blast radius and speeding up recovery.

This means clearly identifying what “healthy” and “unhealthy” look like for each component, based on real user flows and business thresholds for performance and availability. These definitions should guide the metrics you monitor and help trace issues back to their root cause.

## Evolve with Azure

Design your architecture with modularity and flexibility, making it easier to adopt new features without major rework. Regularly review and stay aligned with the latest cloud-native capabilities and Azure service updates. Evolve your architecture in step with the Azure platform roadmap to ensure long-term sustainability and optimization.

 ## Next step

Start your design journey by review how Well-Architected Framework pillars apply to mission-critical class of workloads.
