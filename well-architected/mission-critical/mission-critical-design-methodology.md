# Design methodology for mission-critical workloads on Azure

Designing a mission-critical application on any cloud platform demands a thoughtful engineering approach. There's complexity related to: understanding the platform's capabilities, selecting the right services, configuring them correctly, operationalizing them effectively, and staying aligned with evolving best practices and service roadmaps.

To navigate this complexity, establish a clear and simple design methodology that aligns with your business requirements, particularly around uptime and recovery. When decision-making becomes challenging or you find yourself stuck in analysis paralysis, return to your methodology as a reference point. It can help validate your choices, keep your design focused, and ensure alignment with your overall goals.

This article suggests a design methodology that's informed by insights gained from reviewing numerous mission-critical applications deployed on Azure.

## Design for your reliability objectives


Mission critical doesn't mean the same for everyone. The architecture will vary by the workload's business requirements and acceptable downtime. Those are often defined by Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as 99.9% vs. 99.999% availability. Consider availability objectives to be more than just uptime. They represent consistent service relative to a healthy application state. As a starting point, teams should define how much downtime is acceptable. Use an Uptime/Downtime calculator to determine the tolerable downtime.  

This design methodology can serve as a starting point for architectural decisions and tradeoffs after objectives have been set. As a draft target architecture takes shape and cost and complexity become clearer, the initial requirements may be revisited, challenged, adjusted, or addressed through alternative solutions.

For example, while a single-region, multi-zone setup may suffice for many critical workloads, higher reliability demands more engineering effort and complexity. Avoid defaulting to complex solutions like active-active multi-region unless there are strong requirements to do so.

RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) are also key in defining reliability needs. For example, if your goal is to recover an application in under a minute, backup-based or active-passive strategies likely won't be fast enough.

## Strive for end-to-end automation

Adopt a comprehensive automation strategy that spans both deployment and ongoing management activities. This methodology emphasizes consistency, repeatability, and resilience through automation-first principles. 

Typical areas for automation are routine tasks, such as patching, scaling, and monitoring, to reduce manual effort and errors. Favor templates for configuration and deployment to ensure consistency and clarity, using scripts only when templates aren't viable.

## Design for zero-downtime deployments

Zero-downtime deployments ensure users don't experience any disruption during changes. 

This methodology demands rigorous prerelease testing so that updates don't introduce defects, vulnerabilities, or instability. To support this, deployment tools and processes must be highly available and resilient. 

Consistency is key. The same artifacts and automated processes should be used across all environments to eliminate any chance of manual errors and reduce overall risk. End-to-end automation isn't just preferred; it's mandatory for achieving reliable, repeatable, and interruption-free deployments.

## Design for fast failure detection and recovery

Fast failure detection starts with a well-defined health model. Because failures often cascade across components, early detection and clear dependency between workload components are non-negotiable for minimizing the blast radius and speeding up recovery.

This means clearly identifying what _healthy_ and _unhealthy_ look like for each component, based on real user flows and business thresholds for performance and availability. These definitions should guide the metrics you monitor and help trace issues back to their root cause.

## Evolve with Azure

Design your architecture to be modular and flexible so it's easier to adopt new features without major changes. Regularly review your design to stay current with Azure's evolving services and capabilities. Prioritize Azure-native managed services for their lower operational overhead and better integration. Since Azure updates frequently, aligning your architecture with its roadmap helps ensure your application stays optimized and future-ready.
