# Well-architected assessment for Azure Virtual Desktop workloads

The [Azure Well-Architected Azure Virtual Desktop workload assessment](/assessments/1ef67c4e-b8d1-4193-b850-d192089ae33d) is a review tool for self-assessing the readiness of your Azure Virtual Desktop workload in production. Running a desktop and application virtualization service on Azure can be a complex process. The assessment is organized so that you can methodically check your alignment with best practices for the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars.

For best results, the team that completes the assessment should be well versed in the architecture of your workload. That team should also have a strong understanding of cloud principles and patterns. These roles include but aren't limited to cloud architects, operators, and DevOps engineers.

The assessment is a set of questions that are based on the [Azure Virtual Desktop design areas](../azure-vmware/design-principles.md) as a way of checking the foundational design choices of your workload's architecture and your end-to-end operational approach.

These questions are designed to help benchmark your workload's maturity and alignment with the recommended approach for operating a Virtual Desktop workload. The outcome of the assessment is the delivery of technical recommendations and documentation that provide guidance on how to implement a highly reliable solution on Azure.
