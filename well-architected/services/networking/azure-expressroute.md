# Azure Well-Architected Framework review - ExpressRoute

This article provides architectural best practice for Azure ExpressRoute. The guidance is based on the five pillars of the architecture excellence:

* Reliability
* Security
* Cost optimization
* Operational excellence
* Performance efficiency

We assume that you have working knowledge of Azure ExpressRoute and are well verse with all of its features. For more information, see [Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).

## Reliability

<!-- 5A. ----------------------------------------------------

    Required

    Follow the Reliability H2 heading with a sentence about how the section contributes to the framework. 

-->

[H2 section introduction here.]

### Design checklist

<!--

    Required    

    A design checklist is always the first H3 in each pillar section.

    Make sure the considerations you document:
    - Are presented in a checklist format.
    - Map to the design principles. Identify the appropriate principle, and then think about your recommendation in relation to it.
    - Focus on the salient features for that pillar as they relate to the product.
    - Provide full coverage of the design principles. (If not all design principles exist, cover no fewer than three design principles.)
-->

As you make design choices for \<product>, review the \[design principles](\<design principles link>) for \<pillar>.

### Recommendations

<!--

    Required    

    The Recommendations H3 is always the second section in each pillar. The content in this section should be formatted as a table.

-->

Explore the following table of recommendations to optimize your \<product> configuration for \<pillar>.

| Recommendation | Benefit |
|--------|----|
| \<Configuration recommendation> | What problem this recommendation will mitigate. |
| \<Configuration recommendation> | What problem this recommendation will mitigate. |
| \<Configuration recommendation> | What problem this recommendation will mitigate. |
| \<Configuration recommendation> | What problem this recommendation will mitigate. |
| \<Configuration recommendation> | What problem this recommendation will mitigate. |

Azure Advisor helps you ensure and improve \<pillar-specific text>. Review the [recommendations](../../contribute-how-to-write-waf-for-azure-offerings.md).

### Policy definitions

<!-- 

    Required

    A list of policy definitions is always the third section in each pillar.

    Provide a list of policies the customer can use for resource governance. After the list of policies, provide a list of all policy definitions available in Azure.
-->
