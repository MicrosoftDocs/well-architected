# Well-architected assessment for Azure VMware Solution workloads

The [Azure well-architected VMware workload assessment](/assessments/2d85e883-bdc4-4854-aaf0-df72c4bcee15) is a review tool for self-assessing the readiness of your Azure VMware Solution workload in production. Running an on-premises VMware technology stack on Azure can be a complex process. The assessment is organized so that you can methodically check your alignment with best practices for the Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars.

For best results, the team that completes the assessment should be well versed in the architecture of your workload. That team should also have a strong understanding of cloud principles and patterns. These roles include but aren't limited to cloud architects, operators, and DevOps engineers.

The assessment is a set of questions that are based on the [Azure VMware Solution design areas](../azure-vmware/design-principles.md) as a way of checking the foundational design choices of your workload's architecture and your end-to-end operational approach.

These questions are designed to help benchmark your workload's maturity and alignment with the recommended approach for operating an Azure VMware Solution workload. The outcome of the assessment is the delivery of technical recommendations and documentation that provide guidance on how to implement a highly reliable solution on Azure.
